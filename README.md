## Description
The purpose of this app is to manage simple data base of Polish rivers eligable for kayaking/canoeing. First step is to create friendly, intuitive interface to read and edit data. This basic module is supposed to be part of the bigger project - a helper application for kayaking tourism: planning routes, finding rent companies, acommodation, calculating costs etc. 

However the main intention of this project is to learn (as the title indicates), to master new skills and technologies, ground and broaden my current knowledge.
